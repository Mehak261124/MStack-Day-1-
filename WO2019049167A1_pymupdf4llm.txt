BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
‘Trifloxystrobin is a member of strobilurin class of fungicides, Trfloxystrobin is
chemically known as {(E)-methoxyimino]-{2-[1-(3-trifluoromethy|-phenyl)-cth
(Eyylidencaminooxymethyl]-phenyl}-acetic acid methyl ester as represented as
formula (1). It is known to possess wide range of fungicidal action with good
preventive and curative properties. Taking into an account wide range of activity
and commercial interest many synthetic routes leading to wifloxystrobin and
intermediates are reported in the literature. They are summarized in the following
discussion,
‘The U.S. Patent No.5,238,956 discloses the use of (2-bromomethyl-phenyl)-[(E)‘methoxyimino} acetic acid methyl ester (intermediate 7) as
fermediate in target
molecule synthesis, without its method of preparation. This patent also discloses,
conversion of (Ef)methyl 3-methoxy-2-[2-(methyl(3triloromethylpheny}oximinomethy!) phenyl|-propenoate to trifloxystrobin in
two steps. Origin ofthe starting material ofthis reaction is not mentioned,
The V.
Patent No. 6.444.850 discloses the novel fungicidal compounds having a
Auorovinyloxyphenyl moiety and its process of preparation. The document
--- Page 3 --Wo 219049167 PCTAN201W0S0560
discloses preparation of (2-bromomethy!-pheny!)-{(E)-methoxyimino-acetic acid
‘methyl ester (intermediate 7). In this method 2-bromo toluene is converted 10
intermediate (7) via Grignard reaction, oxime formation, followed by bromination
reaction. This intermediate (7) i then converted to trifloxystrabin (Scheme -1)

‘The drawbacks of the process are as the key raw material 2-bromo toluene is
relatively expensive, Grignard reaction needs rigorous dry conditions to be
maintained, further (E)-2-methoxyimino-2(o-tolyacetic acid methylester
(2-bromomethylphenyl)2-methoxy iminoacetic acid methyl ester (intermediate?) using reagent N-bromo
(intermediate 6) is converted to bromo derivative (E)
succinamide (NBS) which is an expensive reagent as compared to other
alternatives to bromination reaction
‘The U.S. Patent No, 6,670,496 describes the preparation of [(E)-hydroxyimino]-0tolyl-acctic acid methyl ester (5A), but further lization of this intermediate is
not clearly mentioned inthis patent.

‘The PCT Publication No, WO2013/144924 AI describes the preparation of
tfloxystrobin in (Scheme-2) starting from 2-methyl benzoic acid in multiple
steps in which this acid is converted to acid chloride intermediate (B) which is
then treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to produce keto nitrile intermediate
‘This keto nitrile is then treated with dry hyd
desired intermediate (C). However, in this step about 254% yield is lost due to the
formation of undesired intermediate (D). Moreover, the serious risk is associated
with use of NaCN, which may react with hydrochloric acid, or any other
residual in the system ead to produce toxie hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The
‘nore acid in methanol to form
presence of HCN needs to be monitored in step-2 and step-3 to avoid the escape
‘of the same to the surrounding environment.
--- Page 5 --Wo 219049167 PCTAN201W0S0560
Funther, the formed desired intermediate (C) is present in reaction mixture with
intermediate (D), which cannot be separated by physical methods, hence
intermediate (C) needs to be essentially and selectively hydrolyzed to give Keto
acid which again undergo for the esterification in later stage of the synthesis.
‘Therefore these additional operations put more burden on this route of synthesis
by two extra synthetic steps. The Keto acid thus obtained was treated with
methoxy! amine hydrochloride to provide intermediate (5) as FIZ. isomeric
‘mixture of about 1:1 ratio. This intermediate (5), then treated with thionyl chloride
(SOCL) and methanol to give ester intermediate (6) in 40% overall yield over (5)
steps. Further, bromination of intermediate (6) is resulted to intermediate (7) in
76% yield. Then the intermediate (7) is coupled with intermediate (8) using
‘methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as solvent and potassium carbonate (K:COs)as &
base at 110°C to 120°C to yield trifloxystrobin in 654% isolated yield, which is not
satisfactory for commercial operations. Overall yield of this route is only 19%
Which is not very significant. In this process for preparation of trifloxystrobin,
various steps are involved, so overall cycle time for this route is longer and larger
amount of effluent is generated by this process, which makes the process more
‘cumbersome.
‘The PCT Publication No. WO2017/085747A2 discloses a process for the
preparation of trifloxystrobin, The 2-methyl benzaldehyde is converted to
ceyanohydins intermediate, which is further hydrolyzed to amide intermediate,
Which is further esterified to give ester intermediate, which further converted in to
keto ester intermediate, The same is converted into intermediate (5) and then
esterified to give intermediate (6), which was brominated to give intermediate (7).

‘The afore-mentioned prior art processes for preparing trifloxystrobin, which has
certain drawbacks, such as some of the processes contain long synthetic routes,
multiple steps along with the use of toxic reagents such as sodium cyanide
Jpotassium cyanide while some of other methods suffered with low yield and
ly less viable. Some of the prior art process requires rigorous dry
conditions such as those using Grignard reaction, Few prior reported synthetic
routes are utilizing more expensive stating materials, Moreover, due to long
synthetic routes, there is generation of huge effivent, which consequently
increasing the cost of the preparation of wifloxystrobin. Based on the aforementioned drawbacks, the prior art processes may be unsuitable for the
preparation of tiloxystrobin in commercial scale operations.
‘To address these shortcomings in the prior art and develop industrially and
‘economically viable process for trifloxystrobi
the present inventors motivated to
pursue the instant invention and surprisingly found an improved process for
preparation of selectively ((E)-methoxyyimino}-o-toly|-acetic acid (compound 5) in
‘one step and which further converted to trfloxystrobin in a simple manner,

‘The current invention relates to the selective synthesis of [(E)-methoxyimino}-otolylacetic acid (compound 5) and further conversion to the same in 10
trifloxystrobin (1), which is starting from o-toluidine in four simple steps. o‘oluidine (compound 1) is eated with sodium nitrite to produce 2-methy!
benzene diazonium chloride (compound 2), which is further treated with glyoxylic
acid (E) methoxime (compound 4) in presence of copper sulphate or copper
sulphate hydrate to form (£)-2-methoxyimino-2-(o-tolylacetic acid (compound 5)
in better yields and purity. This compound (5), which is selectively E-isomer is
then converted in 3 simple steps to trifloxysteobin in very good yields and high
purity (above 98%). The key starting material in this invention is o-toluidine
Which is inexpensive and can be sourced easily at commercial level. After
diazotization of o-oluidine, itis then treated with coupling partner glyoxylic acid
(£) methoxime (compound 4, prepared from the compound 3), which is stable and,
can be isolated a solid product if required. In present invention the compound (5)
is made in single isomeric form i.e. (E) the required isomer, which was esterified
to (E)-2-methoxyimino-2-(o-olyl)acetic acid methyl ester (compound 6) using
‘methanol and sulfuric acid or methanol and thionyl chloride in 60% overall yield
‘over 2 steps. The compound (6) was brominated in presence of metal halogenates
to produce compound (7), Furthermore, coupling of (E}
bromomethylphenyl)-2-methoxy iminoacetic acid methyl ester (compound 7) with
‘compound(8) using acetone as solvent and K:COs base at 20°C to 30°C to yield
trifoxystrobin in 90% isolated yield. Alternatively, the crude compound (5) can
be converted to compound (6) and further to compound (7) without isolation of
‘compound (6) by applying acid-base treatment to the compound (5). ‘This will
reduce the reaction time, utility cost on commercial scale, The synthetic steps in
‘current invention are straightforward and does not require any special equipment.
Overall handling and product yield are good and can be reproduced at large
‘commercial scale, The overall yield achieved for the preparation of trifloxystrobin
is 40.2% as compared with reported overall yield ie. 19%
