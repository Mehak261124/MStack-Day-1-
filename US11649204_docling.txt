The drawbacks of the process are as the raw material 2-bromo toluene is relatively expensive; Grignard reaction needs   rigorous conditions to be  maintained, further (E)-2-methoxyimino-2-(o-tolyl)acetic acid methyl ester (intermediate 6) is converted to bromo derivative (E)-2-(2bromomethylphenyl )-2-methoxy iminoacetic acid methyl ester (intermediate 7) reagent N-bromo succinamide (NBS) which is an expensive reagent as compared to other alternatives to bromination reaction. key dry using

The PCT Publication No. WO2013/144924 Al describes the   preparation of   trifloxystrobin in (Scheme-2)   starting from 2-methyl benzoic acid in multiple steps in which this acid is converted to acid chloride intermediate (B) which is then treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to produce keto nitrile intermediate. This keto nitrile is then treated with hydrochloric acid in methanol to form desired intermediate (C). However; in this step about 25% yield is lost due to the formation of undesired intermediate (D). Moreover; the serious risk is associated with use of NaCN, which may react with hydrochloric acid, or any other acidic residual in the lead to produce toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The presence of HCN needs to be monitored in step-2 and step-3 to avoid the escape of the same to the surrounding environ-ment\_ dry system

Further; the formed desired intermediate (C) is present in reaction mixture with intermediate (D); which cannot be separated  by  physical   methods, hence intermediate needs to be essentially  and selectively hydrolyzed to give Keto acid which undergo for the esterification in later stage of the synthesis. Therefore; these additional operations put more burden on this route of synthesis by two extra synthetic steps. The Keto acid thus obtained was treated with methoxyl amine hydrochloride to provide intermediate (5) as ElZ isomeric mixture of about 1:1 ratio. This intermediate (5), then treated with thionyl chloride (SOCI2) and methanol to give ester intermediate (6) in 40% overall yield over (5) steps. Further; bromination of intermediate (6) is resulted to intermediate (7) in 76% yield. Then the intermediate (7) is coupled with intermediate (8) using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as solvent and potassium carbonate (KzCO; as isolated   yield, which   is not satisfactory for   commercial operations . Overall yield of this route is only 19% which is not   very   significant. In this   process preparation of trifloxystrobin; various steps are involved; so overall time for this route is longer and larger amount of eflluent is generated by this process; which makes the process  more cumbersome again for cycle

The PCT Publication No. WO2017/085747A2 discloses a process for the preparation of trifloxystrobin: The 2-methyl benzaldehyde is converted to   cyanohydrins   intermediate, which is further hydrolyzed to amide intermediate; which is converted in to keto ester intermediate\_ The same is con verted into intermediate (5) and then esterified to give intermediate (6), which was brominated to give intermediate (7). This   patent   application also describes the coupling reaction of (E)-2-(2-bromomethylphenyl )-2-methoxyimino acetic acid methyl ester (intermediate with 1-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl )-ethanone oxime (intermediate 8) to produce trifloxystrobin (as depicted in Scheme-3 ) The starting material used 2-methyl benzaldehyde is an expensive raw material .

## Advantages of the Present Invention

1 The intermediate  (E)-2-methoxyimino-2-(o-tolyl)acetic acid (compound 5) is synthesised in single step; as compared to art process, which has more number of steps 2 The key raw material of the instant invention such as o-toluidine is common starting material and easily avail able in large scale at commercial level. 3. In instant invention (E)-2-methoxyimino-2-(o-tolyl)acetic acid is obtained directly in an (E)-isomeric form and it is essential for further conversion into trifloxystrobin; while comparing to other literature processes the present invention is distinct and advantageous. 4 In instant invention   trifloxystrobin is produced   using lesser number of steps with 40.2% overall yield; while the literature reports many step syntheses with overall yield 19%. 5 The instant invention does not require  the use of any hazardous reagent; therefore; the said process is environment friendly and safe\_ 6. In literature step (f) was performed at higher temperature high boiling solvents such as DMF  DMA which are difficult to separate from triflox ystrobin. The high temperature reaction causes impurity formations; which results in lower yield (about 65%) of trifloxystrobin. However; the present invention was performed by low boiling solvents such as acetone at room temperature (20 â‚¬. to 300 C.) to produce trifloxystrobin (88% yield). 7 The instant invention produces trifloxystrobin in high yield (90% with high chemical purity (98-99.5%).
