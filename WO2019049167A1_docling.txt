## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Trifloxystrobin is a member of strobilurin class of fungicides. Trifloxystrobin is chemically   known as [(E)-methoxyimino]-{2-[1-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-eth(E)-ylideneaminooxymethyl]-phenyl }-acetic  acid methyl  ester as represented as formula (I). It is known to possess wide range of fungicidal action with preventive and curative properties. Taking into an account wide range of activity and commercial interest many synthetic   routes   leading to   trifloxystrobin and intermediates are reported in the literature . are summarized in the following discussion. good They

The U.S. Patent No.5,238,956 discloses the use of (2-bromomethyl-phenyl)-[(E)methoxyimino]-acetic acid methyl ester (intermediate 7) as intermediate in target molecule synthesis, without its method of preparation. This also discloses conversion of (E,E)-methyl 3-methoxy-2-[2-(methyl(3 trifluoromethylphenyl)oximinomethyl)   phenyl]-propenoate to   trifloxystrobin in two steps. Origin of the starting material of this reaction is not mentioned. patent

The drawbacks of the process are as the raw material  2-bromo toluene is relatively   expensive; Grignard reaction needs   rigorous conditions to be maintained, further (E)-2-methoxyimino-2-(o-tolyl)acetic acid methyl ester (intermediate 6) is converted to bromo derivative (E)-2-(2-bromomethylphenyl) 2-methoxy iminoacetic acid methyl ester (intermediate7) using reagent N-bromo succinamide (NBS) which is an expensive reagent as compared to other alternatives to bromination reaction. key dry

The PCT Publication No. WO2013/144924 Al describes the   preparation of trifloxystrobin in (Scheme-2) starting  from 2-methyl benzoic acid in multiple steps in which this acid is converted to acid chloride intermediate (B) which is then treated   with sodium cyanide (NaCN) to produce keto nitrile intermediate. This keto nitrile is then treated with hydrochloric acid in methanol to form desired intermediate (C). However; in this step about 25% yield is lost due to the formation of undesired intermediate (D). Moreover, the serious risk is associated with use of NaCN, which may react with hydrochloric acid, or any other acidic residual in the   system lead to produce toxic   hydrogen   cyanide   (HCN). The presence of HCN needs to be monitored in step-2 and step-3 to avoid the escape of the same to the surrounding environment. dry

intermediate (D), which cannot be   separated by   physical methods, hence intermediate (C) needs to be essentially and selectively hydrolyzed to give Keto acid which Therefore; these additional operations put more burden on this route of synthesis by two extra synthetic   steps. The Keto acid thus obtained was   treated with methoxyl amine hydrochloride to   provide intermediate   (5) as EIZ isomeric mixture of about 1:1 ratio. This intermediate (5), then treated with thionyl chloride (SOClz) and methanol to give ester intermediate (6) in 409 overall over 5 steps. Further; bromination of intermediate (6) is resulted to intermediate (7) in Then the intermediate (7) is coupled with intermediate   (8) using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as solvent and potassium carbonate (KzCOs)as a base at 110 C to 120 C to yield trifloxystrobin in 65% isolated yield, which is not satisfactory for commercial   operations . Overall of this route is only 199 which is not very significant. In this process for preparation of trifloxystrobin; various steps are involved, so overall cycle time for this route is longer and larger amount of effluent is generated by this process; which makes the process more cumbersome. again yield yield

The PCT Publication No. WO2017/085747A2 discloses à process for the preparation of   trifloxystrobin: The 2-methyl   benzaldehyde is converted to cyanohydrins intermediate, which is further hydrolyzed to  amide intermediate, which is further esterified to give ester intermediate, which further converted in to keto ester   intermediate. The same is converted into intermediate (5) and then esterified to give intermediate (6), which was brominated to give intermediate (7) This patent   application also describes the coupling reaction of (E)-2-(2bromomethylphenyl)-2-methoxyiminoacetic acid methyl ester (intermediate 7) with   1-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-ethanone   oxime to   produce trifloxystrobin (as depicted in Scheme-3). The starting  material used   2-methyl benzaldehyde is an expensive raw material.

- 4 In instant invention trifloxystrobin is produced lesser number of steps with 40.29 overall yield, while the literature reports many step syntheses with overall yield 199. using
- 5. The instant invention does not require   the use of any hazardous   cyanide reagent; therefore; the said process is environment friendly and safe.
- 6 In literature step (f) was performed at higher temperature about 120 C high boiling solvents such as DMF, DMA which are difficult to separate from The high temperature reaction causes impurity formations , which results in lower   yield of   trifloxystrobin. However, the present invention was performed by using low boiling solvents such as acetone at room temperature (20 C to 309C) to produce trifloxystrobin (889 yield) using polar
- 7 chemical purity (98-99.59).
